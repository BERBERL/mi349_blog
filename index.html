            <h3>Making Films</h3>
            <p><img src="Fello.jpg" width="321" height="443" alt="Fello"></p>
            <p>Since this thursday(12th Oct.), I will be start making a film project with my group members. My group and I are 
                in DS441 class, and we have a total of two film projects to do this semester. e will be working on four videos, three 
                of which will be commercials for the software <em>Fello</em>, and one will be a short drama. We'll be working on the three videos 
                starting this Thursday, we decided on the plot and outline at the beginning of the semester, and we wrote the script last 
                week after a pitch. <em>Fellow</em> is a new, not-yet-launched software fully funded by MSU, produced by one of 
                our team members. This software aims to make artistic communication easier. People can see musicians, directors, producers, etc. 
                around them on the software, and it will be a software and ecology that will help each other and benefit each other. Our short 
                commercial was also inspired by what Fello wanted to achieve. It highlights the fact that the user is not alone, he will be 
                surrounded by a community of talented people. Our scenes will be desert, green field, and under the spotlight. The diversity of 
                scenes and the different professions of actors will show the artistic diversity and richness that Fillo brings to the people.</p>

            <h3>New Playstation</h3>
            <p><img src="Playstation.jpg" width="464" height="354" alt="PS5"></p>
            <p>Just two weeks ago, I officially decided to buy a PS5 to replace my old PS4. among so many dazzling game consoles in the market, 
                I don't know why I love Playstation. nowadays, many big games can be played not only in the console, but also on the computer. 
                But I feel that using the handle to sit in front of the TV, the kind of detailed control and vibration feeling, etc., is the 
                computer can not give me. This has also determined me to get a PS5. After getting the console, my roommate and I became slightly 
                crazy and we played the PS5 from the time we received it until midnight on the first day. It's cool and it is looking great, but 
                it did not met my expectations. I think everyone would expect something more when they change a new phone or laptop, same as PS5, 
                I didn't see that much change on this new generation console excpet huge change on how it looks. But I think I would accept it,
                 at least I won't make another change for years.</p>
